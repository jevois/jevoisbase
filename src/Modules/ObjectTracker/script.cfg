# Demo configuration script for ObjectTracker module.

# Set camera to fixed color balance, gain, and exposure, so that we get more reliable colors than we would obtain under
# automatic mode:
setcam autowb 0
setcam autogain 0
setcam autoexp 0
setcam redbal 110
setcam bluebal 170
setcam gain 16
setcam absexp 500

# Detect a light blue flash drive:
setpar hrange 95...110
setpar srange 100...255
setpar vrange 60...253

# Send info log messages to None, send serial strings from module to Hard serial port:
setpar serlog None
setpar serout Hard

# Apply high gain to our pan/tilt servos, sending the commands below to our Arduino over the Hard serial port that we
# configured above to handle the serout messages. The Arduino controlling the pan/tilt servos will receive and parse
# these commands, and will set the servo gains:
serout PANGAIN 400
serout TILTGAIN 300
